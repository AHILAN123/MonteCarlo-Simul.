# MonteCarlo-Simulation-Engine

A project focused on building a Monte Carlo simulation engine from scratch, progressing from core stochastic simulations to financial modeling and AI/ML-enhanced analysis.

## Scope
- Phase 1: Core Monte Carlo simulation framework  
- Phase 2: Financial models (asset pricing, risk, portfolios)  
- Phase 3: AI/ML integration for parameter estimation and acceleration  

## Tech Stack
- Python (numerical computing, finance, ML)
- C++ (high-performance simulation core)

This project aims to explore uncertainty-driven systems through computational simulation.
